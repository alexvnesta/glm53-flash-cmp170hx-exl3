# GLM-5.3-Flash EXL3 serving — 2× 64GB GPUs (CMP 170HX / SM80)

Full-VRAM serving stack for **GLM-5.3-Flash** with **DFlash2 K7 speculative
decoding**, tuned for two 64 GB GPUs with **no P2P support** (e.g. CMP 170HX
mining cards). It also runs stock **MTP d2** as an alternative speculation
mode. ExLlamaV3 sources are not modified; every engine adjustment here is a
process-local monkeypatch that is enabled only while this server runs.

## Validated configuration

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Target model | `turboderp/GLM-5.3-Flash-exl3` @ `3.05bpw` (pinned revision) |
| Engine | ExLlamaV3 1.5.4 (SM80 native build) |
| Drafter | `incoai/GLM-5.3-Flash-DFlash2` BF16 → self-converted EXL3 6bpw (~0.96 GiB) |
| Speculation | DFlash2 K7 (default) or MTP d2 |
| KV cache | Q8 (MLA latent), FP16 profile also available |
| Service context | 384K (Q8) / 320K / 256K / 192K (FP16) |

| GPUs | 2× 64 GB, SM80, no P2P (host-bounce D2D) |
| Split budget | `-gs 62,63` (each number is a per-component load budget, not a VRAM split) |

All weights stay resident in HBM: no CPU expert tier, no SSD paging, no
runtime weight transfer. This is a Strata-style HBM-first layout rebuilt on
ExLlamaV3: the memory that grows with context (KV cache, drafter state) is
kept small instead of offloading weights.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Environment (venv + ExLlamaV3 1.5.4 built for SM80 + API deps)
scripts/setup.sh

# 2. Serve. First run downloads the target (~125 GB) and the BF16 drafter
#    (~2 GB) from Hugging Face, then converts the drafter to EXL3 6bpw
#    (one-time, tens of minutes). Later runs reuse ./models.
scripts/serve.sh --profile q8_384k

# 3. Use it
curl http://127.0.0.1:8012/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"GLM-5.3-Flash","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}],"max_tokens":512}'
```

Requirements: CUDA toolkit with `nvcc` (compute_80), Linux, ~140 GB free disk
for models + conversion workspace, and both GPUs free of other workloads.
The server refuses to start if either GPU has less than ~64 GB free.

`HF_TOKEN` is not required for these public repos, but set it if you hit rate
limits during the first download.

## Profiles

| Profile | Cache | Context limit (input+output) | Loader margin | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| `q8_384k` | Q8, 393,216 tokens | 392,960 | 128 MiB | lm_head reserved on GPU 0; tightest layout |
| `q8_320k` | Q8, 327,680 tokens | 327,424 | 256 MiB | |
| `q8_fast` | Q8, 262,144 tokens | 261,888 | 192 MiB | |
| `fp16` | FP16, 196,608 tokens | 196,352 | 256 MiB | stock speed-first profile |
| `mtp` | same as `fp16` | 196,352 | 256 MiB | stock MTP d2 instead of DFlash2 |

`-gs` is ExLlamaV3's **per-component load budget**, not a VRAM split. For the
MTP profile the effective split is `59,63` because the MTP head is loaded onto
GPU 0 first; see `glm/glm_profile.py` for the validated values.

## API

- Base URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8012/v1` (model id `GLM-5.3-Flash`, no API key)
- `POST /v1/chat/completions`, `POST /v1/completions`, SSE streaming
- Reasoning is returned as `reasoning_content`, the answer as `content`
- OpenAI `tools` / `tool_choice` / `role: tool` messages are supported
- `GET /health` reports cache format, context, speculation mode, draft ring size
  and prefix-cache stats (`prompt_cache`: hits/misses/restored tokens).
- `GET /v1/models` reports the active context limit
- Defaults: `reasoning_effort=high`, `temperature=1.0`, `top_p=0.95`,
  `max_tokens=32768`. One request runs at a time; the rest wait up to 120 s.
- `timings` exposes ExLlamaV3-native `prompt_ms` / `predicted_ms` plus draft
  accepted/rejected counts and `cached_tokens` (also in
  `usage.prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens`), so PP/TG/acceptance and cache
  hits can be measured from the client without trusting SSE arrival times.

Prefill chunks follow the loader `--chunk_size` by default. An optional
`--prefill-chunk-size` or `GLM53_PREFILL_CHUNK_SIZE` cap changes serving chunks
without changing loader placement; see [prefill controls](docs/prefill_chunk.md).

Optional [adaptive DFlash rounds and stats](docs/adaptive_dflash.md) are
experimental and disabled by default. Fixed K7 remains the default.

## How the memory budget works

The 384K Q8 profile is the largest layout that fits on 2× 64 GB with this
checkpoint:

- Target weights: ~116.6 GiB, fully resident across both GPUs
- Q8 KV cache (11 MLA layers, latent quantized): ~4.51 GiB at 384K
- DFlash2 drafter: ~0.96 GiB weights + 8K-token GPU ring cache for its KV
- lm_head reserved on GPU 0 before the transformer split (`--q8-head-gpu0`)
- Autosplit margin 128 MiB (`EXL3_AUTOSPLIT_MARGIN_MB`)

448K and 512K fail during the final transformer-layer load with this
checkpoint and layout; they are not offered as profiles.

### Why the drafter KV is a ring cache

The drafter uses a fixed 2048-token sliding window. Its logical cache still
matches the target context, but the physical GPU storage is an 8,192-token
ring that recycles pages; absolute RoPE positions and the attention window are
unchanged. This is what lets the drafter serve a 384K request without a
384K-token draft cache. The ring is verified for equivalence against the
unbounded cache (bit-exact outputs over repeated wraps); see the experiment
notes in the blog post this repo accompanies.

## DFlash2 drafter conversion

`dflash2/convert_drafter.py` wraps the stock ExLlamaV3 converter with two
process-local adjustments (the ExLlamaV3 tree itself is never modified):

1. `k_proj`/`v_proj` stay BF16 — serving builds a fused context-KV weight from
   the qkv projection's K/V rows, which must remain a plain tensor.
2. `DFlash2DynConv.kernel_projection` Linears are given a qmap so they enter
   the quantization budget (env `DRAFT_QUANT_KERNEL_PROJ=0` to keep them BF16).

`dflash2/package_native.py` then restores every unquantized tensor byte-for-byte
from the BF16 source and writes native `quantization_config` / `tensor_storage`
metadata so ExLlamaV3 1.5.4 loads the result directly. Result: 36 quantized
linears at 6-bit trellis, ~0.96 GiB drafter weights.

Conversion uses synthetic-Hessian calibration only (DFlash2's
`uncalibrated_quantize` capability); no target-model forwards are involved.

## Engine notes

- `k_hcfuse` fuses the four mHC decode launches per sublayer site into two,
  bit-exact against the stock kernels (shadow-check mode: `GLM53_K_HCFUSE_CHECK=1000`).
  It JIT-compiles on first decode (SM80, nvcc); subsequent runs reuse the build cache.
- The async generator runs native GPU steps on a dedicated worker thread so the
  HTTP loop stays responsive; disconnect cancellation is shielded until the
  in-flight GPU step and native job cleanup finish.
- Q8 staging bounds packed-pool gather copies to 32K-token tiles and pins the
  quantized-append workspace to two fixed buffers per GPU, so repeated requests
  do not accumulate VRAM.
- Prompt KV reuse is opt-in in the DFlash2 mode and enabled by default when
  launched through `scripts/serve.sh` (`--dflash-prefix-cache`; disable with
  `GLM53_PREFIX_CACHE=0`). The drafter ring has no snapshot of previous
  requests on its own, so the prefix manager pairs each target recurrent
  checkpoint with a host-RAM snapshot of the last 2048 drafter tokens and
  restores both on a cache hit. A prefix miss, a mismatched checkpoint, a
  cancelled request or an engine error all fall back to cold prefill.

  Measured on the validated host (temperature 0, seed 42, 1K/8K/32K repeats):
  first-token latency for a repeated 1K prompt dropped 1.50 s → 0.65 s, an 8K
  conversation follow-up 7.86 s → 1.11 s (93.98% tokens reused), and a 32K
  follow-up 28.49 s → 1.12 s (98.42% reused). The host snapshot costs ~43 MiB
  of CPU RAM per stored checkpoint; GPU VRAM usage was unchanged within
  measurement noise. Greedy outputs for the repeated inputs matched the
  cold-run outputs, but longer real-text follow-ups at 8K/32K did not fully
  reproduce the full-reprocess outputs in the native GPU comparison, so the
  defect is documented rather than fixed — treat the reuse path as validated
  for the measured repeat cases, not as proven lossless in general.
- Warm prefill throughput and the reuse-time saving are separate metrics.

## Known limitations

- One active request; concurrent requests are queued (up to 120 s wait).
- Multimodal input and JSON-schema-forced output are unsupported.
- Q8 cache changes numerics; no bit-exactness vs FP16 is claimed for outputs.
- 448K/512K do not fit with this checkpoint; the goal of reaching 1M context
  remains open.
- The conversion pipeline and profiles were validated on this specific host
  (Ryzen 5 5600X, DDR4, PCIe Gen2 x8). Other hosts may need different margins.
